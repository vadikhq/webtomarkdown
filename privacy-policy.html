<p><h1>Privacy Policy for Web to Markdown Extension
</p><p>
<strong>Last updated: [Current Date]</strong>
</p><p>
<h2>Overview
</p><p>
Web to Markdown ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.
</p><p>
<h2>Information We DON'T Collect
</p><p>
<strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including:</strong>

- ❌ Usage analytics or statistics
- ❌ Device information
- ❌ Location data

</p><p>
<h2>How the Extension Works
</p><p>
<strong>All processing is done locally in your browser:</strong>
</p><p>
- ✅ Web page content is processed entirely within your browser
- ✅ Markdown conversion happens on your device only
- ✅ No data is sent to external servers
- ✅ No network requests are made by the extension
- ✅ All converted content remains on your device
</p><p>
<h2>Permissions Used
</p><p>
Our extension requests the following permissions, used only for core functionality:
</p><p>
<h3>Required Permissions:
- <strong>activeTab</strong>: Access current page content for markdown conversion
- <strong>downloads</strong>: Enable downloading converted markdown files
- <strong>scripting</strong>: Inject conversion scripts into web pages  
- <strong>sidePanel</strong>: Display the conversion interface
- <strong>tabs</strong>: Manage tab information for conversion
- <strong>storage</strong>: Save user preferences locally in Chrome
- <strong>host_permissions (<all_urls>)</strong>: Access any website for conversion
</p><p>
<h3>Why We Need These Permissions:
- <strong>Content Access</strong>: To read and convert web page content to markdown
- <strong>File Operations</strong>: To allow you to download converted markdown files
- <strong>User Interface</strong>: To provide the side panel conversion interface
- <strong>Local Storage</strong>: To remember your preferences between sessions
</p><p>
<h2>Data Storage
</p><p>
<strong>Local Storage Only:</strong>
- User preferences are stored locally in Chrome's storage
- No data is synchronized or backed up to external servers
- You can clear all extension data through Chrome's extension settings
</p><p>
<h2>Third-Party Services
</p><p>
<strong>We do not use any third-party services:</strong>
- ❌ No analytics services (Google Analytics, etc.)
- ❌ No crash reporting services
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No social media integrations
- ❌ No external APIs or services
</p><p>
<h2>Children's Privacy
</p><p>
Our extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The extension is designed to work entirely locally without any data collection.
</p><p>
<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy
</p><p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the extension's store listing and within the extension itself. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
</p><p>

- ✅ Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies
- ✅ Google's User Data Policy
- ✅ GDPR requirements (no data collection)
- ✅ CCPA requirements (no data collection)
</p><p>
<h2>Your Rights
